Last updated: February 9, 2024
Please read these terms of service (“Agreement”) carefully as this Agreement constitutes a binding contract between the user that accepts this Agreement (“Customer”) and Bench Accounting Inc., a Delaware company having its registered address at 800 North State Street, Suite 304, Kent County, Dover, DE 19901 (“Bench”) governing your access to the Bench website at https://bench.co (“Site”) or use of the services (“Bench Services”) available through the Site and any mobile applications (each an “App”) through which they may be made available (the Site, Bench Services and the App shall be collectively referred to herein as the “Services”). By checking an opt-in box, clicking on “I accept” or otherwise accepting this Agreement on the sign-up page, installing the App, accessing any content on the Site or otherwise accessing or using the Services, Customer acknowledges that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement. If Customer is using the Services on behalf of an entity, partnership, or other organization, then Customer represents that they: (i) are an authorized representative of that entity with the authority to bind that entity to this Agreement and (ii) such entity agrees to be bound by this Agreement. If Customer does not agree to the terms of this Agreement, then they are not permitted to use the Services.

Bench reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter this Agreement, or any policy or guideline applicable to the Services, at any time. If Bench does so, reasonable efforts will be made to communicate these changes via a notice on the Application and this Site.  

Unless otherwise specified, any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised Agreement on this Site, and continued use of the Services after such time will constitute an agreement to be bound by the updated Agreement.  It is recommended that review of this Agreement be conducted from time to time.  The Agreement will always show the ‘last updated’ date at the top.

ARBITRATION NOTICE. Except for certain kinds of disputes described in the Arbitration provision below, Customer agrees that disputes arising under this Agreement will be resolved by binding individual arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, CUSTOMER AND BENCH ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. CUSTOMER AGREES TO GIVE UP CUSTOMER RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend Customer rights under this contract (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a single ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. See the Arbitration provision below.

1. Services.
The Services consist of cloud-based financial tools and services which may include (i) bookkeeping, accounting data storage and processing services, (ii) financial information storage and reporting, (iii) tax preparation and support services which may be performed by a third party tax service preparer (“Tax Services”), and (iv) the service of communicating information to, from and among Third Party Servicers, as per Customer instructions. Customer may make certain selections of Services that they wish to procure through the Application or the Account.

Bench will provide the Services to Customer for the term of this Agreement, subject to the payment of applicable Fees and compliance with the terms of this Agreement. As part of the Services, Bench hereby grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable right to use the Services, as per the terms of this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that the Services are cloud-based and hosted services and no copies of the Services or Bench System will be delivered to Customer, other than (where available) the App, subject to the End User License Agreement (“EULA”). The Services shall be used by Customer solely for Customer’s own purposes and Bench does not convey any right, title or interest in the Services or Bench System to Customer. Customer’s right to use the Services shall terminate upon any termination of this Agreement or termination of the supply of the Services to Customer.

Financial Transactions

Bench shall not perform any financial transactions for Customer. Customer may, however, be able to use the Services to communicate Customer instructions to a Third Party Servicer of Customer which Third Party Servicer may perform a financial transaction on behalf of Customer pursuant to the Third Party Servicer Agreement. Bench is not liable for any such financial transaction or the results thereof.

Errors

Customer shall immediately notify Bench of any errors by Bench or Customer in the supply or use of the Services. Where practicable, Bench shall use commercially reasonable efforts to investigate errors, but makes no representation as to its ability to correct the error. Customer shall provide Bench with any information necessary to investigate an error in a Transaction. Some payment transactions, such as wire transfers, are irreversible, so Customer agrees to exercise extreme caution when initiating any financial transaction by way of instructions delivered to one of its Third Party Servicers through the Services.

Tax Services

Customer acknowledges that Bench will provide Tax Services only if and upon Customer’s completion of a validly executed Taxpayer Disclosure Authorization in which Customer consents to allow Bench to disclose certain tax information as specifically described therein for such period until Customer is no longer using Bench’s tax return preparation services. Customer understands and acknowledges that Bench will not provide Tax Services until such Taxpayer Disclosure Authorization is executed and provided to Bench.

Customer further acknowledges and consents to the fact that Bench may employ third party tax filing preparer services to complete the Customer’s tax filing needs.  Customer further acknowledges that any disputes in relation to tax filings will be dealt with directly with the third party tax preparer, and Bench takes no liability in such tax filing errors, if any.

2. Bench Account and Customer ID.
Bench shall provide Customer with a unique and private Account accessible through the Service. The Account shall be a record of Customer Transactions and Fees. Bench shall provide Customer with access codes for the Account. Customer shall not disclose such codes or permit any third party to use them. Customer has exclusive responsibility for the use of Customer Account. Bench will invite Customer to enter certain preferences and specifications within the Application or the Account that will apply to the Services; Customer assumes exclusive responsibility for such selections even if they contain errors by Customer or result in losses to Customer. Any additional terms and conditions posted to the Site with respect to the Account or specific Services preferences selected by Customer are incorporated herein by reference.

Except as required to deliver the Services or as otherwise required by law, Bench shall not grant any third party access to Customer Account.

Customer shall notify Bench by email to help@bench.co immediately of any loss or disclosure, whether voluntary or otherwise, of any Account password or access code to a third party.

Upon Customer’s request, Bench will also issue Customer a Customer ID associated with the Account (“Customer ID”). Customer may share their Customer ID only with officers, directors, bookkeepers, accountants or other Customer personnel that are directly employed or engaged by Customer (“Customer Personnel”) provided that Customer binds such third parties to undertakings of confidentiality and to also honor the terms hereof. Customer Personnel may only access and use the Services through the Customer ID and in compliance with this Agreement; Customer will not allow Customer Personnel to share the Customer ID with third parties. Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under its Customer ID whether by Customer Personnel or otherwise. Bench reserves the right to replace the Customer ID in its sole discretion for any reason or for no reason. Any Customer Personnel who accesses the Services does so subject to this Agreement.

Customer shall provide, at Customer’s own expense, all necessary hardware, applications and internet connectivity necessary to access the Services. Customer acknowledges that the internet can be unpredictable in performance, unsecure and may, from time to time, impede access to the Services or performance hereunder. Customer agrees that Bench is not responsible for any internet outages, unsecure WIFI or other connections or any other interference with Customer’s use of or access to the Services or security breaches arising from any Customer Device and Customer waives any and all claims against Bench in connection therewith.

Financial Data Storage, Not Advice

The Services enable the storage of Customer Data that is of a financial nature (e.g., bookkeeping, accounting and other financial information). Customer acknowledges, however, that the Services (other than the tax preparation and advisory services) do not include the supply of any accounting, financial, investment, legal or other professional advice. Bench is not an accounting or other professional services firm. Bench does not hold any licenses for the supply of any accounting, financial, investment, legal or other professional advice, and none of the Services shall be construed as including any such services. Data presented in the Services, such as financial information, for example, shall not be construed as reflective of the financial status of Customer or any third party nor are they necessarily compatible with any specific accounting standards, such as GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). Customer shall be exclusively responsible for retaining third party any accounting, financial, investment, legal and other professional advice.

Customer Call Monitoring

Bench may monitor and record support-related and other outbound calls to Customer, as well as inbound calls to Bench by Customer or Customer’s representatives, for compliance, support, training and other purposes.

Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Bench, its employees, officers, directors, Affiliates, suppliers, licensors, Third Party Servicers and other customers against any and all liability including damages, recoveries, deficiencies, interest, penalties, losses and reasonable attorney’s fees arising out of or relating to: (i) any breach of the terms hereof; (ii) any breach of a Third Party Servicer Agreement; (iii) any violation of any Laws; (iv) any use of Customer Data by Customer or a Third Party Servicer or other third party; (v) Customer use of the Services, including in combination with any third party service; (vi) any Transaction; (vii) any financial transaction occurring as a result of data communicated via the Services; (viii) any act or omission of any Third Party Servicer or Client; (ix) costs incurred by Bench enforcing the terms hereof or responding to any subpoena relating to Customer, Customer Data or a Third Party Servicer; (x) any claim by a governmental taxing authority; (xi) any dispute between Customer and any third party or Customer Personnel; or (xi) Customer’s use or misuse of the content on the Site, including, without limitation, infringement claims.

8. Term and Termination
Term

The term of this Agreement shall begin as of when Customer accepts this Agreement, completes the Application or obtains an Account, shall continue in effect for an initial period of either one month or one year, depending on Customer’s selection at account activation (the “Initial Term”), and shall automatically renew for a period of the same duration as the Initial Term upon the expiration of the Initial Term or any subsequent term (each, a “Renewal Term” and, together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless either party provides the other with advanced written notice (of 15 days for monthly terms or 60 days for yearly terms) of its election not to renew this Agreement before the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable.

Termination

Customer may cease using the Services by closing their Account or such other means as the Services may provide, but doing so does not act to terminate this Agreement. Customer must provide Bench with written notice in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph that Customer elects not to renew this Agreement when the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term expires. Customer will be responsible for any Fees due during the remainder of the Term. Bench may terminate this Agreement by notice to Customer through the Account, by email to the contact information provided in the Application or by other electronic notice to other contact information provided by Customer to Bench.

9. Customer Support.
Bench will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with technical support services relating to the Services via its technical support website, email, or telephone.

Bench may update the Services in its sole discretion which updates may alter, add or remove functionality of the Services. Bench may also, from time to time, schedule downtime for maintenance and upgrades to the Services.

10. Fees.
Fees

Access to the Services may require Customer to pay Fees, as further described at https://www.bench.co/pricing or otherwise on the Site, the App or in the Account. All Fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable, unless otherwise provided herein. Bench reserves the right to amend the Fees by posting new Fees on the Site, in the App or in the Account; such changes shall take effect within thirty (30) days unless accepted by Customer earlier or if Customer does not close their Account within such delay.

Payment

Customer shall authorize Bench to collect payment of Fees from a credit card, debit card or other means of payment; Customer authorizes Bench to charge all Fees and other amounts owing hereunder, including all applicable taxes, from such payment method. If Customer pays any Fees with a credit card, Bench may seek pre-authorization of Customer’s credit card account prior to Customer’s purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover Customer’s purchase.

The Services may include functionality for activating, updating, or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If Customer activates or updates recurring payments through the Services, Customer authorizes Bench to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until expiration or termination of the Term, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. Customer must provide Bench with written notice of its election not to renew the Term before it renews to avoid billing and payment for the next recurring Renewal Term. For example, if Customer has a one-year long Initial Term and a subscription plan providing for 12 monthly payments during the Initial Term, (a) if Customer provides Bench with written notice of its election not to renew this Agreement before the expiration of the Initial Term, Customer will be responsible for any remaining monthly payments during the Initial Term but not for any subsequent Renewal Term, however, (b) if Customer fails to provide Bench with written notice of its election not to renew this Agreement before the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will renew for another year and Customer will be responsible to pay the 12 monthly payments during the Renewal Term. If Customer updates or cancels any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to 10 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.

Without limitation, Bench reserves the right to cancel the Services until all Fees or other amounts owing hereunder are paid in full or terminate this Agreement for late payment.  Bench further reserves the right to refer Customer to a collections agency if Fees are delinquent after final notice is served.

Fees quoted do not include, and Customer shall pay and hold Bench harmless from all sales, use, gross receipts, value-added, personal property or other taxes, and all applicable duties, tariffs, assessments, export and import fees or similar charges (including interest and penalties imposed thereon) on the transaction contemplated herein, other than taxes based on the net income or profits of Bench.

ACH Consent

Customer desires to effect settlement of credits and debits from Customer Bank Account(s) by means of ACH and/or wire transfer in conjunction with the Services for Customer by Bench. In accordance with this desire, Customer authorizes Bench and/or its affiliates to initiate debit and credit entries to Customer Bank Account (the details of which are provided by Customer through the Account or by other means acceptable to Bench). Customer shall maintain sufficient funds in Customer Bank Account to cover such debit transactions. Customer states that Customer has the authority to agree to such transactions and that Customer Bank Account indicated is a valid and legitimate account for the handling of these transactions. This authority is to remain in effect until Bench receives written notice from Customer revoking it. This authorization is for the payment of Fees or any other sums owed to Bench. Customer certifies that the appropriate authorizations are in place to allow Customer to authorize this method of settlement. All changes to the identification of Customer Bank Account under this authorization must be made in writing in accordance with the Agreement. Customer understands that if the information supplied as to the ABA Routing Number and Account Number of the Customer Bank Account is incorrect, and funds are incorrectly deposited, Bench will attempt to assist Customer in the recovery of such funds but has no liability as to restitution of the same. Bench’s assistance in recovering the funds, where available, will be billed to Customer at Bench’s current hourly rate for such work. Customer acknowledges that the origination of ACH transactions to the Customer Bank Account must comply with the provisions of U.S. law.

11. Confidential Information.
Each party acknowledges that it may directly or indirectly disclose Confidential Information to the other party in the course of negotiation of and performance of this Agreement. All such Confidential Information disclosed hereunder shall remain the sole property of the disclosing party (or other third party), and the receiving party shall have no interest in, or rights with respect thereto, except as set forth herein. Each party agrees to treat such Confidential Information with the same degree of care and security as it treats its most confidential information. Each party may disclose such Confidential Information to employees and agents who require such knowledge to perform services under this Agreement. Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, neither party shall disclose the Confidential Information of the other party to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, and the duty of confidentiality created by this section shall survive any termination of the Agreement. Customer Data shall, without limitation, be Customer Confidential Information. Bench Data shall, without limitation, be Bench Confidential Information.

12. Customer Representations and Warranties.
Customer represents and warrants to Bench that:

12.1. Customer has the legal authority to bind Customer organization to this Agreement and to perform hereunder and under each Third Party Servicer Agreement to which Customer is a party. Customer is the exclusive owner of the Account and is not operating the Account on behalf of any third party.

For contractual purposes, Customer (i) consents to receive communications from Bench in an electronic form; and (ii) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, documents, disclosures, and other communications (“Communications”) that Bench provides to Customer electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such Communications would satisfy if it were in writing. Customer’s consent to receive Communications and do business electronically, and Bench’s agreement to do so, applies to all of Customer’s interactions and transactions with Bench. The foregoing does not affect Customer’s non-waivable rights. If Customer withdraws such consent, from that time forward, Customer must stop using the Services. The withdrawal of Customer’s consent will not affect the legal validity and enforceability of any obligations or any electronic Communications provided or business transacted between Bench prior to the time Customer withdraws its consent.

By providing Bench with Customer’s mobile telephone number, Customer consents to receiving text messages at that number as requested for account verification, invitations, and other purposes related to the Services. While Bench does not charge a fee for text messages, Customer’s carrier may charge standard messaging, data, and other fees. Customer is responsible for these charges. Bench may send and receive text messages through cellular telephone operators or other networks, and the level of reliability may vary. Bench is not responsible for the timeliness or final delivery of the message, as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of the cellular telephone operator or other networks.
