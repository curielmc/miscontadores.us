Other Service Providers, Partners, Contractors or Vendors: for analytics and reporting, marketing and advertising, auditing, communicating with you, managing our customer database, providing you with professional services, managing our recruitment process and conducting background checks (for Prospective Benchmates).
Successor Entities: if we merge with or are acquired by another company, are involved in a bankruptcy, or if the ownership or control of all or part of our Services or their assets changes, information about you may be transferred to such entities.
Law Enforcement, Government Agencies, and Professional Advisors: to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, threats to physical safety, illegal activity, or violations of a contract or our policies, or to comply with a law or regulation, or if we are otherwise legally required to do so, such as in response to a court order or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims or demands.
We also share certain categories of personal information with third parties to provide personalized online advertising and with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Under the CCPA, some of this information sharing may be broadly considered a “sale” of Personal Information. Except for this type of sharing, we do not sell your Personal Information. We share identifiers (such as name, email address, IP address and online identifiers), commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity information, and inferences drawn from personal information with third parties for these purposes. If you are a California resident, you can opt out of the sale of your personal information as described above.

Where your data resides 

Our Services are managed by Bench’s team headquartered in Canada and operating from locations around the world. Our Services are hosted in the United States and individuals located within the United States are permitted to use our Services. If you circumvent Bench’s measures restricting our Services to the United States and use our Services from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal information outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing. Also, we may transfer your personal information from the United States to other countries or regions in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating our Services. By providing any information, including information from or about you or your devices, on or to our Services, you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.

Data retention

Bench is a United States company, serving US persons and businesses, and as such, we and our affiliates may be subject to various legal compliance and reporting obligations that require us to retain your personal information for a specific period of time which may be beyond the time when you stop using our Services.

How we protect your information

We maintain security safeguards to protect your information, which are designed to ensure its confidentiality, integrity and availability. While we strive to protect your information on our Services, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your personal information. To learn more about our information security measures, please see our Security Practices.

How we use cookies and other tracking technologies

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our Services. For more information about how we use these technologies, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect updates to our Services, applicable laws, and other factors. We will notify you as outlined above when we materially change the ways in which we use or share personal information previously collected from you through our Services, but we encourage you to stay informed by reviewing this policy periodically.
